- Question: What role does cervical mucus play in sperm transport?
  Answer: Cervical mucus is important for allowing sperm to swim through the cervix to reach the Fallopian tube where fertilization occurs.

- Question: How does cervical mucus change during ovulation?
  Answer: During ovulation, cervical mucus becomes more alkaline, and the fibers align in parallel with an expanded distance between them, allowing sperm to swim through.

- Question: What is the primary function of cervical mucus?
  Answer: The primary function of cervical mucus is to bathe sperm in a fluid medium to protect them during transport.

- Question: How does clomiphene citrate (CC or clomid) affect cervical mucus production and function?
  Answer: CC causes decreases in the volumes and quality of cervical mucus and makes it more difficult for sperm to penetrate. Women on CC are seven times more likely to have "hostile" cervical mucus that is difficult for sperm to penetrate.

- Question: What is the prevalence of CC use among couples with fertility problems?
  Answer: Estimates suggest that 40% of couples with fertility problems utilize CC at some point for the woman.

- Question: What is the role of lubricants in sperm transport?
  Answer: Some lubricants can harm sperm and create a vaginal environment that limits sperm transport. Pre~Seed® is a lubricant that can replenish vaginal moisture without harming sperm.

- Question: What can be done to help the chances of conceiving for older men?
  Answer: 
    - Be sure and have a sperm chromatin assay done in addition to a normal semen analysis (visit www.scsadiagnostics.com to learn more), so that you know if sperm DNA damage is present. 
    - When providing a semen sample for testing or for clinical procedures, use Pre~Seed® as a sperm-friendly lubricant to help make semen sample collection more pleasant. 
    - There is also a growing body of evidence that vitamins with antioxidants help men with low fertility. 
    - Make sure you have intercourse timed with ovulation to optimize the chances of sperm and egg meeting. 
    - Vaginal dryness and a lack of secretions during your fertile window makes intercourse uncomfortable and can interfere with fertility. Supplementing your secretions with Pre~Seed® makes “baby-making” more fun.


- Question: Is declining fertility with age only a female issue?
  Answer: No, declining fertility with age is not just a female issue. Studies have shown that aging in men can also have a significant effect on sperm quality and can lead to delays in pregnancy.

- Question: What is the effect of aging in men on time to pregnancy for their partners?
  Answer: In a study of 2,000 couples, men that were over 45 years of age had a five-fold increase in time to pregnancy for their partners (how long it took them to become pregnant) as compared to younger men.

- Question: What percentage of couples became pregnant within 3 months of trying to conceive in the study mentioned?
  Answer: In the study mentioned, 57% of these 2,000 unselected couples became pregnant within 3 months of trying to conceive, and 81% after 1 year.

- Question: What are the potential causes of delays in fertility in older men?
  Answer: Similar to the changes seen in women, delays in fertility in older men may be due to DNA or chromosomal abnormalities in the sperm of older men. Studies have found that the DNA of sperm in men ages 36-57 had far more breakage in the strands than did sperm from men ages 20-35, which have been associated with infertility, early embryo losses, miscarriages, and even birth defects or cancer in children. Other studies have suggested that age-related changes in sperm quality may be due to environmental toxin damage or a loss of internal antioxidants in semen in aging individuals.


- Question: What are the top 4 reasons for failing to conceive?
  Answer: Over 75% of the time, couples that are not conceiving have one of the following four problems; poor sperm quality, abnormal cycle, tubal problems, or poorly timed intercourse.

- Question: How long should a couple try to conceive before seeking medical attention if the woman is younger than 35 years old?
  Answer: If the woman is younger than 35 years old, a couple should seek medical attention if they have not conceived after trying for a year.

- Question: How long should a couple try to conceive before seeking medical attention if the woman is 35 years old or older?
  Answer: If the woman is 35 years old or older, a couple should seek medical attention if they have not conceived after trying for 6 months.

- Question: What is the cause of poor sperm quality in a man?
  Answer: At least 50% of the time, poor sperm quality is due to abnormal or poor quality sperm. This may be all of the problem or partially the problem, with both the man and the woman contributing.

- Question: How can a man improve his sperm quality?
  Answer: The better intercourse feels for him and the more foreplay, the MORE sperm the man can make. Pre~Seed® can also help make things slippery fun.

- Question: What is an abnormal cycle in a woman?
  Answer: An abnormal cycle often has to do with hormonal abnormalities and can be seen as failure to ovulate or cycle normally, or chemical pregnancy and losses.

- Question: How can a woman determine if she has an abnormal cycle?
  Answer: A woman can work with an ObGyn or RE to evaluate how her ovaries are functioning. Keeping a careful, detailed log of when she has her period, when she has any ovulation mucus, and any other information on her cycle can also be helpful. The very best book on monitoring this is Toni Weschler’s book Taking Charge of Your Fertility.

- Question: What are tubal problems in women?
  Answer: Tubal problems in women refer to blocked tubes which keep the sperm and egg from meeting.

- Question: How can a woman determine if she has tubal problems?
  Answer: The only way to know if a woman has tubal problems is to have special testing done. In general, couples often wait too long to have this testing. If a woman has had a history of Chlamydia or bacterial vaginosis, she should have this checked.

- Question: What is the most common reason for poorly timed intercourse?
  Answer: The most common reason for poorly timed intercourse is that some women ovulate a little later than OPKs suggest, so couples are quitting the baby dance too soon.

- Question: How often should couples have intercourse to increase their chances of conceiving?
  Answer: Regular intercourse 2-3 times a week has been shown to be almost as effective as every day well-timed intercourse.
